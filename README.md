Fruity Live Wallpaper
=====================

Whilst creating a Fruit Ninja clone (https://github.com/emmaguy/FruitNinja) I accidentally put the chance of a new piece of fruit being added to the screen way too high - and thought it'd make a nice live wallpaper

With thanks to the following posts:
http://www.blackmoonit.com/2012/07/all_api_prefsactivity/ for compatiblity with older API versions.
http://robobunny.com/wp/2011/08/13/android-seekbar-preference/ for slider to choose opacity of fruit.
